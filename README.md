# Sentences Coherence Classification with Language Models
This is my project for the Computational Linguistics II exam (University of Pisa). In this work, I addressed the task of Assessing DIScourse COherence in Italian TEXts, EVALITA 2023, using the techniques studied during the course.

The entire project is described in the report, available only in Italian.

The data have been excluded; only the scripts are included.
